     *  Hello fellow developer! This is Errol Pineda, the developer of the website for
     *  NYC 2013. If you're reading this, you've probably chosen to use the Twenty-twelve theme
     *	to use on this year's NYC website.
     *
     * 	I'm assuming you've noticed that in certain parts of this site, specifically the front
     *	page, the header and sidebar is missing. I'm also assuming, not to sound condescending or
     *	anything, that either you have little knowledge, if not none, about PHP, OR you just can't
     * 	understand this geeky stuff in this part of the site. Anyway, these files have been manipulated
     *	to make way for the hidden header and sidebar functionality of the front page of the website:
     *		./wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/comments.php
     *		./wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/header.php
     *		./wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/sidebar.php
     *	There's this part in the code that says '<?php if(!is_front_page()): ?>. Simply delete it and its
     *	corresponding <?php endif; ?> down below the code. However, the condition !is_front_page() has
     *	another condition accompanying it, simply delete the condition; there's no need to find and delete
     *	the <?php endif;?> in the later part of the code.
     *
     *	Or you could just download another theme file for Twenty-twelve if the above instructions are too
     *	tedious for you. lol
     *
     *	That should be all, thank you for taking time to read this and may you have luck developing this
     *	year's NYC website!
